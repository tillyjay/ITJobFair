# IT Job Fair Clone 

## WordPress IT Job Fair Website
This project was about replicating my college's IT Job Fair site within WordPress. Not going to lie it was a little frustrating at first to input content using WordPress's visual/code editor in order for the content to be updatable easily with a CMS. Once I got the hang of input blocks or HTML I could focus on the important aspect of styling the Job Fair site's WordPress Theme. I found this super entertaining as I love working with front-end tech so it was really rewarding to see my clone match up against the real site including the functionality. 

## Features 
- Stylized buttons for links and registration forms.
- Mobile friendly content.
- Collapsible tables.
- Contact hyperlinks and icons.
- Map of location.
For all of the features check out the live site: https://www.itjobfair.ca/

## Technologies Used
- WordPress Dashboard for theme creation
- PHP
- HTML5
- Bootstrap

## Lessons Learned
- Improved my skills working with WordPress and creating a custom theme.
- Practiced CSS skills to create the custom styling.
- Used JavaScript to create collabsible table content. 
- Used PHP to add in style sheets and custom scripts.
- Used PHP to output Header, Footer, and page content.

## Future Improvements 
- Ensure all styling is uniform, there were some discrepancies within the styles like the buttons and spacing between content.
- Improve readability of WordPress content to make it easier for non-coders to update site content.
